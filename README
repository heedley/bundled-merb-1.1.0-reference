Thanks to the efforts of Pavel (github.com/pk), you can now use Merb with Carl & Yehuda's awesome new gem bundler (github.com/wycats/bundler). If you're working on a merb app, I would highly recommend trying this out and if it works ok, ditching the old thor tasks.

These steps are a work in progress so let us know how it works out for you. I'll try and get some pages up on the Merb wiki soon that has a better step by step tutorial.

First step, install bundler (latest 0.6.0)
gem install bundler

Install Merb 1.1 from Edge
git clone git://github.com/wycats/merb.git
cd merb
gem install rspec extlib # required for merb's rake install

New Project
# generate new project using merb 1.1
merb-gen app bookstore
cd bookstore

# create bundled app 
gem bundle

# now you can run the bundled merb console
bin/merb -i

# you'll want to use bin/rake to use the app's rake tasks with the bundled gems
bin/rake -T

# you'll probably also want to install mongrel/thin to the bundle
echo 'gem "mongrel"' >> Gemfile
gem bundle

# now you can run bin/merb to start the server
bin/merb
